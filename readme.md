# Build instruction

To run the code, you need to modify the `src/main/java/backends/ConnectDB` to add `user` and `pwd`.

Also, the project is built by maven, please use maven commands `tomcat7:run` to build it instead of running in IDE.

There is **no** local dependency, make sure the code is not running via local environment.

Allonsy.
